# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Adding Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To Write a python program to perform the basic right shift operation for the user given integer number with 3 shift.  

## ALGORITHM

1.Begin the program.

2.Prompt the user to enter an integer value.

3.Read and store the integer value.

4.Perform a right shift operation on the integer by 3 positions (number >> 3).

5.Use the print() function to display the shifted result.

6.Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM

n=int(input())

print(f"{n} >> 3 = ",n>>3)
